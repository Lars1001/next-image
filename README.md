Need help developing app for teaching any subject. in my case SEL (Social Emotional Learning) and MCT in an entertaining fashion in order to increase EQ/EI (Emotional Intelligence). This will again make user learn about democratic important principles, ESG and SRI. Promote psychological and ultimatley -  world peace !

The app can be graphic and illustrative and interactice. Learning by doing. Teaching core principles and building blocks one by one. Like a pyramid where the ground floor represents fundamental knowledge. Higher up Democratic values and SRI and ESG is of importance. The 4 sides of the 3D or 4D pyramid represents Physical needs, social and pschological needs, Intersocial and society aspects, basic school and educational curriculums. As the builder progress up wards in building the pyramid by learning the blocks, it is important for the avatar to be standing level. If one side is underdeveloped, the floor will tilt and avatar might slide or fall towards the underdeveloped side.
I am a GP (General Practioner specialiced in general medicine) trained MCT (Metacognitive Therapist) and CBT (Therapist) Have limited knowledge in programming and hope someone will find interest in helping:

According to ChatGPT : That's a great concept! Let's start by setting up a basic Next.js application. We'll use Tailwind CSS for styling and Radix for UI components. We'll also use OpenAI API for any AI-related features and Langchain JS for language-related features. Here's a basic setup:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
